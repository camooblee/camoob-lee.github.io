    <p> Cooking has always been interesting to me because of how much variety
		it has to offer. <br /> There is so many different flavors and dishes that it is	
		endless opportubnities to try and cook! <br/>So far I have tried all sorts of
		different ethnic dishes and feels like I am only 1% done for trying 
		every kinds of food! <br/><strong>Food like Primerib is delicious! </strong>
